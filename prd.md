# Decentralized Solana Social Network - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Product Overview

### 1.1 Product Vision

A decentralized social network built on Solana blockchain that enables users to create profiles, post content, and send private messages in a fully on-chain manner. The product will be delivered as an SDK to allow developers to build their own frontends to interact with the network.

### 1.2 Target Users

- Blockchain enthusiasts who value decentralized platforms
- Developers looking to build applications on top of a decentralized social graph
- Solana users seeking a censorship-resistant social platform
- Web3 community members who want control over their data and communications

## 2. Core Features

### 2.1 Profile Creation

Users can create an on-chain profile with the following attributes:

- Username (must be unique)
- Bio (text description, character-limited)
- Profile picture (stored as IPFS hash)

**Requirements:**

- All profile data must be stored on-chain and easily accessible via the SDK
- Username uniqueness must be enforced at the contract level
- Profile creation requires wallet signature for authentication
- Profile picture limited to specific dimensions and file size to optimize storage costs
- Ability to update profile information

### 2.2 On-chain Posting

Users can publish text posts that are stored directly on the Solana blockchain.

**Requirements:**

- Text-only posts stored using Solana Memo Program
- Each post must be associated with the creator's wallet address
- Posts must include timestamp and be retrievable by profile
- Character limits enforced to optimize on-chain storage costs
- Post creation requires wallet signature

### 2.3 Private Messaging

Users can send private, encrypted messages to other users on the network.

**Requirements:**

- Messages encrypted on the sender side and stored on-chain
- Only the intended recipient can decrypt messages using their wallet
- Message metadata (sender, recipient, timestamp) is stored on-chain
- Message content is encrypted end-to-end
- UI provides a simple interface for message sending, receiving, and decryption
- Message sending requires wallet signature

## 3. Technical Architecture

### 3.1 On-chain Components

An Anchor program deployed on Solana that handles:

- Profile data storage and management
- Message encryption/storage
- Post storage via Solana Memo Program integration
- Authentication and permission management

**Account Structure:**

1. Profile Account:

   - Owner (wallet public key)
   - Username (string)
   - Bio (string)
   - Profile picture (IPFS hash)
   - Created timestamp
   - Last updated timestamp

2. Message Account:

   - Sender (wallet public key)
   - Recipient (wallet public key)
   - Encrypted content
   - Timestamp
   - Read status

3. Post Reference (via Memo Program):
   - Mechanism to link memo transactions to specific profiles

### 3.2 Off-chain Components

#### 3.2.1 SDK

A comprehensive JavaScript/TypeScript SDK that offers:

- Full interface to interact with the on-chain program
- Profile management functions (create, read, update)
- Posting functionality
- Message encryption/decryption utilities
- Wallet connection and transaction signing
- TypeScript typings for improved developer experience

**SDK Structure:**

- Core module for blockchain interaction
- Auth module for wallet connection and verification
- Profile module for profile management
- Post module for content creation and retrieval
- Messaging module for encrypted communications
- Utility module for common operations

#### 3.2.2 Reference UI Implementation

A web-based UI that demonstrates the SDK functionality:

- Modern, responsive design
- Wallet connection using modern wallet adapters (Phantom, Solflare, etc.)
- Profile creation and management interface
- Post creation and viewing
- Messaging interface with encryption/decryption
- Basic user discovery

## 4. Security Considerations

### 4.1 Authentication & Authorization

- All write operations require valid wallet signatures
- Profile ownership verified through on-chain account ownership
- Message access restricted to sender and recipient only

### 4.2 Encryption

- End-to-end encryption for private messages
- Public key cryptography using wallet keys for encryption/decryption
- No storage of private keys or sensitive data off-chain

### 4.3 Rate Limiting & Spam Prevention

- Transaction fee structure to naturally limit spam
- Design considerations for future addition of proof-of-humanity or other anti-spam mechanisms

## 5. Storage Strategy

### 5.1 On-chain Storage

- Profile data stored directly on Solana blockchain
- Posts stored via Solana Memo Program with optimized data structure
- Message content stored encrypted on-chain
- Storage costs optimized by enforcing size limitations

### 5.2 IPFS Integration

- IPFS used exclusively for profile pictures
- IPFS hash stored on-chain rather than image data
- Strict size and format limitations for profile pictures
- Reference UI handles IPFS uploading and retrieval

## 6. SDK Architecture

### 6.1 Core Functionality

- Wallet connection and transaction signing
- Account creation and management
- Data serialization/deserialization
- Error handling and retry logic

### 6.2 API Design

- Promise-based API design
- Clear documentation with examples
- Consistent error handling
- TypeScript typings for all functions and data structures

### 6.3 Extensibility

- Plugin architecture for future extensions
- Event system for notifications and updates
- Support for custom transaction handling
