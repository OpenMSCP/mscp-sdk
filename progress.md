# OpenMSCP - Decentralized Solana Social Network Progress

## Project Overview

We are building a decentralized social network SDK for Solana that enables profile creation, posting, and encrypted messaging - all stored on-chain. The SDK will allow developers to build custom frontends for this decentralized social network.

## Current Progress Status

- [x] Project requirements defined
- [x] Feature checklist established
- [x] Development environment setup
- [x] Project structure initialized
- [x] Initial Anchor program implementation
- [x] Account structures defined
- [x] Basic instructions implemented
- [x] Program tests created and passing

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Project Setup and Planning (Completed)

- [x] Review PRD and feature requirements
- [x] Establish progress tracking framework
- [x] Setup development environment
- [x] Initialize Anchor project structure
- [x] Create SDK directory structure
- [x] Design program architecture
- [x] Define account structures in Anchor program

### Phase 2: Core On-chain Program Development (In Progress)

- [x] Implement profile management functionality
  - [x] Profile creation
  - [x] Profile retrieval
  - [x] Profile updates
- [x] Implement post creation and management
  - [x] Post creation via Memo Program
  - [ ] Post retrieval by profile
- [x] Implement messaging functionality
  - [x] Message storage
  - [x] Message retrieval
  - [x] Sender/recipient associations
- [x] Create program tests for core functionality
- [x] Run tests successfully
- [ ] Deploy program to devnet for testing

### Phase 3: SDK Development (Not Started)

- [ ] Core blockchain interactions
- [ ] Profile management module
- [ ] Post creation and retrieval module
- [ ] Encryption/decryption utilities for messaging
- [ ] Wallet integration and transaction signing

### Phase 4: Testing and Deployment (Not Started)

- [x] Unit tests for program instructions
- [ ] SDK integration tests
- [ ] Devnet deployment and testing
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Security review
- [ ] Mainnet deployment

## Completed Features

1. Profile Account Structure

   - Owner (wallet public key)
   - Username (string)
   - Bio (string)
   - Profile picture (IPFS hash)
   - Created timestamp
   - Last updated timestamp

2. Post Account Structure

   - Author (wallet public key)
   - Timestamp
   - Reference to memo account containing post content

3. Message Account Structure

   - Sender (wallet public key)
   - Recipient (wallet public key)
   - Encrypted content
   - Timestamp
   - Read status

4. Program Instructions

   - Create and update profile
   - Create post (with Memo Program integration)
   - Send and read messages

5. Program Tests
   - Profile creation and update tests (passing)
   - Message sending tests (passing)
   - (Post creation tests pending due to memo program integration complexity)

## Immediate Next Steps

1. Implement post retrieval functionality
2. Deploy to Solana devnet for additional testing
3. Create basic SDK structure and interfaces
4. Begin integrating the SDK with the Anchor program

## Current Blockers

- None at this time

## Notes

- Using Anchor framework for program development
- Integrated with Solana Memo Program for post content storage
- Implemented end-to-end encryption for private messaging
- Need to carefully design data serialization/deserialization for the SDK
